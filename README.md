* Project Description
   * MySQL Manager is a downloadable web-based database manager. I made it because I wanted a cross-platform tool that's simple and easy to use. I decided I wanted it to be very user friendly, so that a user with little SQL experience could still manage their database. This project is not done; current functionalities include create table, delete table, add row, and delete row. Currently, there are no plans to deploy this.
